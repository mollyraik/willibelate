# Will I Be Late?

A Django Application that answers the simple question on New Yorkers' mind: Will I Be Late? Answer: Probably.

WIBL uses data from the MTA api to show live status updates and upcoming trains for the NYC Subway System. Logged in users can add favorite stations and subway lines for quick access. We cannot control the inconsistent MTA, but we can prepare for potential delays and do our best to get places on time.

## Technologies Used
--- 
Django, Python, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, bit.io

## Future Enhancements
